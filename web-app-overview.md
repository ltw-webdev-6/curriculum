      **Web app overview**

      ## What’s a “web app”

      - **Task oriented** — Perform a task, instead of find info
      - **URL-driven** — On The Web, platform agnostic, sharable
      - **Fully responsive** — Works on all screens & devices
      - **Always up-to-date** — Devs control release cycle

      ## Interactive prototype

      **We haven’t concentrated on designing & coding responsive web applications**

      - Design & code a responsive web application prototype
      - Every screen should be *perceptibly functional*
      - Usable enough to be tested but *not actually functional*
    notes: |
      **Perceptibly functional:** Everything that could be interacted with should do something, open panels, move to screens etc. even if they always do the same thing.

      As an example, an email app like Gmail:

      - Clicking to write a new email will show the compose window
      - Sending the message will always take me back to inbox (and no message will actually be sent)
      - Opening any of the messages in the inbox will always take me to the same message to view
      - Going to the trash will show the same messages
      - Deleting a message will just go back to the inbox without the message disappearing

      ## Teams—yeah!

      - 3 members per team (ideally)
      - Working together on the same code-base
      - Different lead roles
      - One final project, one shared grade

  - content: |
      ## Subject of your choice

      **As a team, pick a focused, small app to design**

      - Weather app
      - Train/bus app
      - Food diary app
      - Fitness diary app
      - Budgeting app
      - *etc.*

  - content: |
      ## Online project management

      - GitHub
      - GitHub Projects
      - GitHub Issues
      - Netlify
      - Slack? Keybase? Zulip? Signal?

      ## Timeline

      - *Half the term on UX*
        <br>(Weeks 1–3)
        <br>&nbsp;
      - *Half the term on code*
        <br>(Weeks 3–7)

  - content: |
      ## Do the UX

      **Do everything expected from you in IxD**

      - Target audience
      - Competitive analysis
      - Sitemaps & task flows
      - Visual design
      - Wireframes

  - content: |
      ## Code the screens

      **Code all the screens and make the app feel functional**

      - Write all the CSS & HTML for each screen
      - Use pattern libraries & Jekyll to automate away the duplicate HTML
      - Work on unique Git branches
      - Use Issues to assign tasks to each other

  - content: |
      ## User testing

      **User testing at two different points:**

      - User test the wireframes
      - User test the final app prototype
