      ## What & why

      Understanding Git branching, and GitHub Flow, is critical to working as a team on the same codebase.

      There are lots of steps to the process and we need to get a visualization, in our heads, of how everything fits together.

      **We’re going to label a visualization of Git commits & branches to help understand the problem.**

      ## Set up

      1. Form into pairs, not necessarily your teams

      3. Label all the important bits
      4. Answer some questions about the Git log

      ## Label these things

      - Note all the commits
      - Label the `master` branch
      - Give each feature branch a name
      - Note where a branch was created
      - Note where a pull request & merge happened

      ## Answer these questions

      - **A** — Is the green button visible on the live website?
      - **B** — Why is the readme visible in this branch’s code?
      - **C** — Why aren’t the cards visible on the live website?
      - **D** — Can the green button be included in the cards?
      - **E** — How would the cards branch get access to buttons?
